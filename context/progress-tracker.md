# Progress Tracker
Update after every meaningful change.

## Current Phase
- Theming epic COMPLETE: units 02 (#2), 02b (#19), 02c (#22), 02d (#24) all MERGED to main
  (#24 closed; commit+PR + device verification done). Store epic underway: 03a (#26), 03b (#29) MERGED.
- **Unit 03 (local store + HLC + outbox) scored COMPLEX → split** (2026-06-08). Build-plan unit 03
  crosses boundaries (core HLC/outbox + store Repository + two platform impls) → split into:
  **03a** core sync primitives + Repository interface (#26, this — specced) → **03b** Dexie/web
  impl → **03c** SQLite/mobile impl (device-bound like 02d). Spec: specs/03a-core-sync-primitives.md.
  Decisions (confirmed): generic record store (not domain-typed; entities land with units 04/07/10);
  shared `runRepositoryConformance` suite both impls run. Route 03a = standard (pure TS, no new dep).

## Unit 02d build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done (apps/mobile): uniwind + Metro (`metro.config.js` withUniwindConfig, `global.css` at app
  root importing tailwindcss+uniwind+`@ember/tokens/theme.uniwind.css`), `babel.config.js`
  (babel-preset-expo), theme provider (default system, `expo-sqlite/kv-store` persistence via
  `getItemSync` at init, `Uniwind.setTheme`), fonts via `@expo-google-fonts` registered under
  token-stack family names, themed shell + accessible segmented control (accent underline on
  raised surface). Pure `coerceStoredPreference` unit-tested (7 mobile tests).
- Built (Sonnet, TDD) → impeccable (redesigned the near-invisible active segment to match 02b's
  accent-underline a11y pattern) → fresh-context review (Opus) = APPROVE-WITH-NITS, NO blockers.
  Reviewer verified the hand-authored `src/uniwind-types.d.ts` is byte-identical to uniwind's
  generator output (Metro wasn't run — no simulator).
- typecheck 8 ✓ · test 5 tasks/42 ✓ · lint 6 ✓. No new async-storage dep (kv-store instead).
- **DEVICE-BOUND (user, before/after merge):** `npx expo start --clear` → confirm the generated
  uniwind d.ts matches the committed one; themed render + Fraunces/Inter apply; live light↔dark
  toggle + `system` follows device; persistence across reload. If `font-serif` doesn't resolve,
  adjust the family-name keys in `app/_layout.tsx`.
- **Bundler fixes (found on first device run; validated headlessly via `expo export -p android`
  → "Android Bundled … Exported: dist"):**
  1. **Metro `.js` resolution** — the repo authors relative imports with explicit `.js` (TS/NodeNext
     style; fine for tsc/Vite). Metro doesn't rewrite `.js`→`.tsx`, so it failed to resolve
     `../src/theme/theme-provider.js`. Fixed with a `resolver.resolveRequest` wrapper in
     `apps/mobile/metro.config.js` that strips `.js` and retries. **Carry-forward: any future RN
     relative import keeps the `.js` convention — Metro handles it via this resolver.**
  2. **reanimated 4 worklets** — `react-native-reanimated@4.4.1` (scaffolded in unit 01, first
     bundled now) needs `react-native-worklets` + its babel plugin. Installed
     `react-native-worklets@0.8.3` (via `expo install`) and added `react-native-worklets/plugin`
     (last) to `apps/mobile/babel.config.js`.
  - Also: expo tooling added `apps/mobile/.gitignore` (+`dist/`), expo-env.d.ts + .expo/types to
    tsconfig include (expo-env.d.ts gitignored, regenerated — not committed).
  3. **SDK-56 version alignment** — unit-01 pinned 6 mobile deps AHEAD of what Expo SDK 56
     supports (latent until first run). `expo install --fix` aligned them (now "up to date"):
     react/react-dom `19.2.7→19.2.3` (must match RN's react-native-renderer exactly),
     react-native-gesture-handler `3.0.0→~2.31.1` (major), react-native-reanimated `4.4.1→4.3.1`,
     react-native-safe-area-context `5.8.0→~5.7.0`, @types/react `19.1.8→~19.2.14`.
     **Lesson: pin Expo-managed native deps via `expo install`, not the bare npm registry —
     SDK 56 lags the latest. Web (Vite) React stays 19.2.7; only mobile is RN-locked to 19.2.3.**
  - After all fixes: `expo export -p android` → "Android Bundled … Exported: dist"; static
    checks typecheck 8 ✓ · test 5 ✓ · lint 6 ✓. Runtime visuals still device-bound (user).
  4. **uniwind className did nothing on device** (first visual run: no styling at all — flex/gap/
     colors/fonts all ignored, though `className` typechecks). Root cause: uniwind's runtime must be
     bootstrapped by **`import '../global.css'` in the root `app/_layout.tsx`** — the metro
     `cssEntryFile` config ALONE is not enough. **Carry-forward: always import the css entry in the
     app root.** Also hid the expo-router default header (`Stack screenOptions headerShown:false`).

## Unit 02c build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done (packages/tokens): added `theme.uniwind.css` (uniwind `@theme` + `@layer theme{:root{
  @variant light/dark}}` form) authored from the same TS source; widened `--font-serif` to
  `'Fraunces Variable', 'Fraunces', serif` in both CSS files; added `./theme.uniwind.css` export.
- Built (Sonnet, TDD) → fresh-context review (Opus) = APPROVE-WITH-NITS → applied the SHOULD-FIX:
  parity test now extracts each `@variant` block body and asserts warm-light/warm-dark values live
  INSIDE the correct block (was a whole-file `.toContain`, which the @theme defaults masked).
- Tokens tests 23 ✓ · web 10 ✓ · typecheck/lint ✓. Invariant #6 intact (single TS source, both
  CSS reps parity-tested).

## Unit 03a build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done: `@ember/core` HLC clock (`hlc.ts`: tick/receive/compare/encode/parse/initialClock — pure,
  caller passes physical time, no `Date.now()`) + append-only outbox (`outbox.ts`: OutboxEntry +
  `makeOutboxEntry` stamping encoded HLC, drops payload on delete; no uuid/crypto in core).
  `@ember/store` `Repository` interface (generic record store + outbox ops), `MemoryRepository`
  reference impl (structuredClone value isolation, hlc-sorted unacked, idempotent ack), and shared
  `runRepositoryConformance(label, makeRepo)` suite (03b/03c plug into it). encode is lexicographic
  & provably agrees with compare (WALL_PAD 15 ⇒ ~year 33658, COUNTER_PAD 8 — overflow out of scope).
- Built (Sonnet, TDD: core 23 tests, store conformance) → fresh-context review (Opus) =
  APPROVE-WITH-NITS, NO blockers/should-fix. Reviewer re-ran all gates + verified the store tsconfig
  change (composite:false/noEmit — mirrors apps/web+mobile) doesn't weaken typecheck or break
  03b/03c (all consumers resolve `@ember/*` to source via paths, nobody reads compiled d.ts).
  Applied 2 nits (wrong comment year; merged duplicate import).
- typecheck 8 ✓ · test 5 tasks ✓ · lint 6 ✓. No new dep. Invariants #1/#2 + core-purity intact.
- **tsconfig carry-forward:** `packages/store/tsconfig.json` now `composite:false`/`noEmit:true`,
  typecheck via `tsc --noEmit` — forced once store gained a cross-package `@ember/core` source
  import. Any future package importing another workspace package's source follows this pattern.

## Unit 03b build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done (packages/store): `DexieRepository` (Dexie 4.4.3 / IndexedDB) — single `records` table keyed
  by compound `[collection+id]` (+ `collection` index) + `outbox` table indexed on `hlc`;
  `structuredClone` on write AND read for value isolation; ctor takes db name (default `'ember'`)
  for test isolation; uses ambient global `indexedDB` (no fake-indexeddb import in impl). Headless
  tests via `fake-indexeddb@6.2.5` in vitest `setupFiles`; conformance run uses a unique UUID db
  name per `makeRepo`. `import { Dexie }` (named) + `import type { Table }` — NodeNext default-import
  gotcha. conformance.ts/repository.ts untouched; core gained no Dexie import.
- Built (Sonnet, TDD: 16 Dexie conformance + 16 Memory + 1 index = 33 ✓) → fresh-context review
  (Opus) = APPROVE-WITH-NITS, NO blockers. Reviewer independently re-ran all gates + confirmed
  core-purity + suite-untouched.
- typecheck 8 ✓ · test 5 tasks/33 ✓ · lint 6 ✓.
- **Follow-up (defer, against 03a's SHARED suite — its own micro-unit, don't weaken in 03b's PR):**
  `runRepositoryConformance` never calls `close()` (no afterEach), so `close()` is uncovered. Add
  an `afterEach(repo.close)` + an idempotent-close assertion to conformance.ts so 03b/03c both
  exercise it. NITs (no action — deliberately consistent w/ MemoryRepository): Dexie `enqueue`
  clones the entry while Memory doesn't; structuredClone shape constraint undocumented in contract.

## Unit 03c build notes (2026-06-09)
- Done (packages/store): tiny async `SqliteDriver` port (`sqlite-driver.ts`: exec/run/all/close +
  `SqlValue`); `SqliteRepository` (`sqlite-repository.ts`: private ctor + static async `create(driver)`
  that runs DDL; records & outbox stored as JSON text → value isolation via JSON.parse, no
  structuredClone; `INSERT OR REPLACE` upsert, `ORDER BY hlc ASC` == 03a encoded-HLC string sort under
  SQLite BINARY collation; idempotent `close()` guarded by a `closed` flag since DatabaseSync throws on
  double-close); `nodeSqliteDriver` (`node-sqlite-driver.ts`: wraps Node 24 built-in `node:sqlite`
  `DatabaseSync`, sync→async, `:memory:` default). Barrel exports port+repo+node driver but NOT the expo
  binding. Also bundled the deferred **close()-coverage micro-unit** into `conformance.ts`
  (`afterEach(close)` + idempotent-close test) — all 3 impls now exercise close().
- Done (apps/mobile): thin `expoSqliteDriver` adapter (`src/store/expo-sqlite-driver.ts`) over
  expo-sqlite async API (openDatabaseAsync/execAsync/runAsync/getAllAsync/closeAsync) — the ONLY file
  importing expo-sqlite. Added `@ember/store` workspace dep.
- Built (Sonnet, TDD: SqliteRepository runs the full shared suite via node:sqlite → store 52 tests =
  17×3 impls + 1 index) → fresh-context review (Opus) = **APPROVE-WITH-NITS**, NO blockers/should-fix.
  Reviewer re-ran all gates + verified suite not weakened, expo-sqlite/node:sqlite each imported in
  exactly one file, core untouched, HLC ordering sound. Applied 2 nits: pinned `@types/node` exact
  (25.9.2, house style) + commented the deliberate `types:["node"]` mobile-tsconfig trade-off.
- typecheck 9 ✓ · test 5 tasks/52 ✓ · lint 6 ✓. No new external dep (node:sqlite built-in;
  expo-sqlite already pinned). Invariants #1/#2 + core-purity intact.
- **BARREL FIX (found on first device bundle — spec was wrong):** the public barrel must NOT
  re-export test-only modules. Metro (mobile) bundles `@ember/store`'s barrel, so exporting
  `node-sqlite-driver` (imports `node:sqlite`) AND `conformance` (imports `vitest`) crashed
  `expo export -p android` with "attempted to import node:sqlite". Fixed: `index.ts` exports only
  the consumer surface (repository/sqlite-driver/sqlite-repository/memory/dexie); tests import
  `conformance.js` + `node-sqlite-driver.js` via relative paths (they already did). This also made
  the mobile `@types/node`/`types:["node"]` additions unnecessary — reverted both; only
  `packages/store` keeps node types (for the node driver file + its test). Verified headlessly:
  `expo export -p android` → "Android bundles (1) … Exported: dist".
  **Carry-forward: never re-export vitest/node-only modules from a package barrel a client bundles.**
- **DEVICE-BOUND (user, before merge):** `npx expo start` in apps/mobile → Home has a `__DEV__`
  "Dev · device verifications" link → **Unit 03c** screen. Tap "Run all" (conformance smoke must go
  green), then for persistence: tap "1. Write persistence marker" → fully reload the app → tap
  "2. Read persistence marker" (must show the pre-reload stamp = real on-disk SQLite persistence).
  Interactive harness, NOT console logs.
- **Device-verification convention established** (ai-workflow-rules.md): every device-bound unit
  drops an interactive screen under `apps/mobile/app/dev/` fed by the shared
  `src/dev/verification-harness.tsx`, listed in `app/dev/index.tsx`, reached via the `__DEV__` home
  link. **Throwaway** — once all checks are green, delete `app/dev/` + `src/dev/` + the home link in
  the same PR (the real `src/store/expo-sqlite-driver.ts` adapter stays). Files added this turn:
  `src/dev/verification-harness.tsx`, `app/dev/index.tsx`, `app/dev/sqlite-03c.tsx`, `__DEV__` link
  in `app/index.tsx`.

## Unit 04d build notes (2026-06-09)
- Done (apps/web): shadcn/ui foundation. `shadcn init` (new-york style — switched off the CLI-default
  `base-nova` because it pulls `@base-ui/react`; new-york uses the unified `radix-ui` pkg) + added
  Button/Card/Sonner into `src/components/ui/`; `@/* → ./src/*` alias in tsconfig + vite + vitest; `cn()`
  in `src/lib/utils.ts`. CSS entry `styles.css`: `@import "tailwindcss"` → `tw-animate-css` → tokens, then
  **shadcn semantic vars aliased BY REFERENCE to `@ember/tokens` vars** (`--primary:var(--color-accent)`,
  `--background:var(--color-surface)`, `--card:var(--color-surface-raised)`, `--foreground/...:
  var(--color-text)`, `--muted-foreground:var(--color-text-muted)`, `--border/--input:var(--color-line)`,
  `--ring:var(--color-accent)`, `--primary-foreground:var(--color-on-accent)`, `--radius:var(--radius-md)`;
  destructive is the one allowed hardcoded fallback — no token yet). Dark mode via
  `@custom-variant dark (… [data-app-theme="warm-dark"] …)` keyed to the EXISTING ThemeProvider attribute,
  NOT `.dark` — and because each aliased token already switches under `[data-app-theme="warm-dark"]` in
  theme.css, shadcn surfaces flip for free. Palette stays single-sourced in packages/tokens (invariant #6).
- Sonner retrofit of 04b: removed the inline notice state/banner; import feedback now `toast.success`/
  `toast`/`toast.error` (added/deduped/rejected, warm voice); `<Toaster>` mounted once in App.tsx, themed
  from our own `useTheme().resolvedTheme` (NOT next-themes, which the CLI assumed — removed it +
  CLI-added geist font). `import-dropzone` accent button → shadcn `<Button>` (kills the `text-white`
  hardcode = 04b nit **N1**). Import/dedupe/OPFS/persistence logic untouched.
- ESLint override scoped to `apps/web/src/components/ui/**` ONLY (vendored shadcn — relaxes filename-case/
  naming/import-order/react-refresh); authored `src/library`+`src/store` stay strict.
- Built (Sonnet) → impeccable (light pass on retrofit) → fresh-context review (Opus) =
  **CHANGES-REQUESTED → fixed**. BLOCKER (a11y): `--color-on-accent` was `#ffffff` — white on the amber
  accent is 3.2:1 (light) / 2.4:1 (dark), fails WCAG AA for button text (same class as 02b's catch).
  **Fixed:** `--color-on-accent` → dark ink `#2a2422` (passes 4.7:1 / 6.5:1) across index.ts + theme.css +
  theme.uniwind.css + parity test. Reviewer verified token aliasing single-sourced, dark wiring, boundary
  isolation (core/store/mobile byte-identical), lint scoping, Sonner tests not hollowed; re-ran all gates.
- Token change this unit: added `--color-on-accent` to packages/tokens (TS + both CSS + parity test) —
  the proper N1 fix (was an app-level `text-white`). Nit (deferred, harmless): the explicit
  `[data-app-theme="warm-dark"]` block in styles.css is redundant (tokens already switch) — left for
  legibility; could be trimmed to a comment later.
- typecheck 9 ✓ · test 29 web + 23 tokens (+ store/mobile) ✓ · lint 6 ✓. Deps added by CLI (sonner,
  lucide-react, radix-ui, cva, clsx, tailwind-merge, tw-animate-css, @types/node). core/store/mobile
  untouched. **Carry-forward: web UI now builds on shadcn (ui-context.md); handroll only the gaps.**
- **BROWSER-VERIFY (user, before merge):** `pnpm --filter @ember/web dev` → import a PDF → bottom-right
  success toast; re-import → "already in your library" toast; drop a non-PDF → error toast; toggle
  System/Light/Dark → shadcn Button/Card + toasts all re-theme; Tab to "Add PDF" → accent focus ring;
  primary button = ember accent with dark-ink label (readable, no white-on-amber).

## Unit 04b build notes (2026-06-09)
- Done (apps/web): `OpfsBlobStore` (OPFS-backed BlobStore, blobs/ subdir, lazy dir handle, copy-
  through inherent); `subtleCryptoHasher` (Web Crypto `crypto.subtle.digest` → lowercase hex);
  `createWebClock` (localStorage-persisted HLC clock + stable device id, fully injectable deps);
  `createWebStore` (composes repo+blobs+hasher+clock into `importPdf`/`listDocuments` surface);
  `StoreProvider`/`useWebStore` (mirrors ThemeProvider shape; skips production store construction when
  injected store prop present — prevents OPFS crash in jsdom); Library screen (`LibraryPage`,
  `ImportDropzone`, `DocumentRow`, `use-library`) with drag-drop + hidden file input, ember flame SVG
  + drag-over "warming" state, warm empty state, inline dismiss-able notices, recently-added-first
  list, relocated theme control in sticky header. All token-only (no hardcoded values). `App.tsx`
  replaced with `<LibraryPage />`; `StoreProvider` wired inside `ThemeProvider` in `main.tsx`.
- Tests: `format-bytes.test.ts` (4), `subtle-crypto-hasher.test.ts` (3 known SHA-256 vectors),
  `web-clock.test.ts` (7 — monotonic stamps, counter bumps, reload persistence), `library-page.test.tsx`
  (5 — empty state, import adds row, dedupe adds no row, non-PDF rejected, theme control aria-pressed).
  OpfsBlobStore NOT unit-tested (no OPFS in jsdom) — browser-verified step below.
- Built TDD-first (Sonnet) → frontend-design (Library screen) → impeccable (polished: em-dash → comma,
  h2 heading hierarchy, dismiss button 44×44 touch target, motion-safe animation guards, `opacity-50`
  empty state icon, items-center row alignment, role="status" loading) → gate fixes (Hasher import from
  @ember/core not @ember/store; Uint8Array cast for TS6; react-hooks/set-state-in-effect restructured
  via loadTick counter; import-x/order; prefer-const; unused var).
- typecheck 9 ✓ · test 29 web (7 files) ✓ · lint 6 ✓. `@ember/store: workspace:*` added to apps/web deps.
  packages/core and packages/store unchanged (byte-identical). Invariants #1/#2/#6 intact.
- Fresh-context review (Opus) = **APPROVE-WITH-NITS**, NO blockers. Reviewer re-ran all gates, hand-
  verified HLC monotonicity-across-reload + counter restore, confirmed packages/ byte-identical to main,
  and independently confirmed the SHA-256 test vectors are correct (`abc`/empty). Nits N2 (spec listed
  `format-bytes.ts` under library/, lives under store/ — organizational, no effect) + N3 (web-store ticks
  the HLC eagerly even on dedupe — harmless, monotonic, no outbox entry written; lazy-stamp would be a
  core change, out of scope) left as-is.
- **Follow-up (defer — own micro-unit against packages/tokens, like 02b's token deferrals; do NOT widen
  04b's diff into the tokens pkg + its parity test):** N1 — `import-dropzone.tsx` accent button uses
  `text-white` (the only hardcoded color; soft invariant-#6 deviation). Add a semantic `--color-on-accent`
  token to `packages/tokens` (TS source + theme.css + theme.uniwind.css, extend parity test) and switch to
  `text-on-accent`. Value is visually fine on the orange accent — quality debt, not a bug.
- **BROWSER-VERIFY (user, before merge):** `pnpm --filter @ember/web dev` → Chromium (localhost, secure
  context) → drop a PDF → row appears with derived title → full page reload → row persists (real OPFS
  + Dexie) → re-drop same file → dedupe notice, no second row. Non-PDF → gentle rejection notice.
  Theme toggle (System/Light/Dark) still works with focus-visible a11y pattern.

## Unit 04a build notes (2026-06-09)
- Done: `@ember/core` document layer (`document.ts`: `Document` type [id=sha256 hex, title, filename,
  byteSize, contentType, importedAt — NO pageCount until reader/05], `Hasher` port, `computeDocumentId`,
  `makeDocument` w/ filename→title strip; pure, caller supplies time/uuid/hlc, core stays runtime-dep-free).
  `@ember/store`: `BlobStore` port (content-addressed by doc id) + `MemoryBlobStore` reference impl
  (Map-backed, slice()-copies in/out for value isolation, idempotent close) + `runBlobStoreConformance`
  (test-only, NOT barrel-exported — 03c Metro carry-forward); `documents.ts` `importDocument` (hash →
  dedupe-by-content-id → new doc: put record + blob + EXACTLY ONE HLC-stamped outbox entry; identical
  bytes = no-op merge, zero 2nd outbox) + `listDocuments` + `DOCUMENTS_COLLECTION`.
- Built (Sonnet, TDD: core 30 [+7 new], store 69 [+9 blob conformance +8 documents]) → fresh-context
  review (Opus) = **APPROVE**, no blockers/should-fixes. Applied 1 nit (merged duplicate `@ember/core`
  import). Reviewer re-ran all gates on a busted cache + verified barrel safety, value isolation, exactly-
  once outbox, core purity, 03a/b/c suites byte-identical.
- typecheck 9 ✓ · test 5 tasks/139 ✓ · lint 6 ✓. No new dep. Invariants #1/#2 + core purity intact.

## Current Goal
- **Unit 06 SCORED COMPLEX → split by boundary (2026-06-11).** Build-plan 06 (Reading position + resume:
  page+offset capture + Today "Continue Reading" card) crosses 4 boundaries (core position model + the
  furthest-page conflict-merge, store syncable record, web UI + first Today surface, mobile UI) → COMPLEX.
  Split like 04a/b/c & 05a/b/c: **06a** core `ReadingPosition` shape + `mergeReadingPosition` (first piece
  of the shared conflict-merge engine, invariant #5) + store `saveReadingPosition`/`getReadingPosition`/
  `listReadingPositions` (#52, this — BUILT, TDD green, Opus-reviewed APPROVE; PR open) → **06b** web reader capture/restore + Today card + tab nav
  (UI unit → frontend-design + impeccable) → **06c** mobile (device-bound, WebView position bridge + native
  Today). Route 06a = **standard** (core+store, pure TS, no new dep; mirrors 04a). Spec:
  specs/06a-reading-position-model.md, branch feat/52-reading-position-model.
  **Design RESOLVED (user, 2026-06-11):** (1) LOCAL save = last-write (literal current position, can move
  backward → resume-where-you-left-off); furthest-page MERGE runs only at cross-device reconcile (unit 12).
  (2) Merge tie-break: furthest page → greater within-page offset → HLC last-write-wins (each position
  record carries an encoded-HLC `updatedAt`). Position record keyed by docId (one per document); each save
  writes record + one outbox entry; scroll-save throttling deferred to 06b/06c UI.
- **Unit 04a (#34) MERGED** — PR #35 merged to main (CI verify ✓ 52s), branch deleted. Shared
  document brain: core `Document`+`Hasher` port+identity, store `BlobStore` port+`MemoryBlobStore`+
  `importDocument` (dedupe-by-sha256, exactly-once outbox)+`listDocuments`. Spec:
  specs/04a-document-model-identity.md. **Decisions (confirmed w/ user):** SHA-256 via `Hasher` port
  (mirrors 03c driver port); PDF bytes via a `BlobStore` port; core runtime-dep-free (zod deferred).
- **Unit 04b (#36) MERGED** — PR #37 merged to main (CI verify ✓ 49s), branch deleted, BROWSER-VERIFIED
  by user (drag-drop + picker import, dedupe, on-disk persistence across reload all ✓). Web import +
  Library list (apps/web): 04a ports bound to browser APIs (`BlobStore`→OPFS, `Hasher`→SubtleCrypto,
  `Repository`→DexieRepository) + minimal localStorage-persisted HLC clock/device id; Library screen
  (drag-drop + picker PDF import, dedupe-by-hash, recently-added-first, empty state, display-only rows).
  See Unit 04b build notes below.
- **UI DIRECTION CHANGED (2026-06-09, user):** adopt **shadcn/ui** as the web component foundation —
  handroll web components only where shadcn has no good fit; otherwise compose shadcn primitives (e.g.
  Sonner toasts, not inline banners). **Supersedes the 2026-06-08 "bespoke, no UI kit" decision** —
  recorded in ui-context.md "Component Library" + the styling memory. Mobile stays bespoke uniwind
  (shadcn is Radix/web-only). shadcn themes via CSS vars mapped to Amber Ember tokens → invariant #6 holds.
- **Unit 04d (#38) MERGED** — PR #39 merged to main, branch deleted, BROWSER-VERIFIED by user (import
  toasts + light/dark re-theming of shadcn surfaces + readable dark-ink button + focus ring all ✓). Web
  UI foundation: shadcn (Button/Card/Sonner) on apps/web, CSS vars aliased by reference to Amber Ember
  tokens, dark mode via existing `data-app-theme`; retrofitted 04b notices → Sonner toasts + accent button
  → shadcn Button (closed nit N1). Review (Opus) = CHANGES-REQUESTED (a11y) → fixed `--color-on-accent`
  white→dark-ink `#2a2422`. See Unit 04d build notes below. Spec: specs/04d-web-ui-foundation-shadcn.md.
- **CI fix (post-review, on the 04d branch):** first CI run RED — `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS: msw@2.14.6`.
  msw is a transitive optional dep of `@vitest/mocker` that entered the lockfile during the shadcn
  re-resolve; it ships a build script, and pnpm fails frozen CI installs until each build script is
  explicitly allowed/denied. **Fixed:** `allowBuilds: msw: false` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (we never
  import msw). Re-run CI verify ✓ 50s. **Carry-forward: any new dep with a postinstall/build script must
  be added to `allowBuilds` in pnpm-workspace.yaml (true to run it, false to skip) or CI install fails.**
- **Unit 04c (#40) MERGED** — PR #41 merged to main (CI verify ✓ 52s, commit 7aecb4e), branch deleted,
  DEVICE-VERIFIED by user (pick → import → toast → reload-persist + dedupe + non-PDF reject + light/dark
  re-theme all ✓), throwaway dev harness removed. mobile import + Library list (apps/mobile).
  **Unit 05 SPLIT + specced (2026-06-09):** build-plan unit 05 (PDF reader on both clients) scored
  **COMPLEX** — crosses web+mobile, two new render deps, AND an unresolved open question → split into
  **05a** web reader (#42, this — specced) → **05b** mobile reader (device-bound, react-native-pdf render +
  headless pdf.js text extraction). Web first: pdf.js is the reference text engine 05b's mobile contract is
  measured against. Umbrella issue #5; sub-issue #42. Spec: specs/05a-web-pdf-reader.md, route **standard**.
  **Open question RESOLVED (user):** mobile extracts its text layer with the **same pdf.js engine**
  (react-native-pdf renders pixels; headless pdf.js extracts text) → identical extraction = highlight-anchor
  parity (unit 10) for free. Consequence: the shared text-layer *shape* is promoted to `packages/core` in
  **05b** (once both clients proven identical), NOT in 05a — 05a keeps text-layer code in apps/web.
  05a scope: pdfjs-dist (6.0.227) reader — continuous-scroll default + paged toggle, virtualized page render,
  selectable text layer, reader theme (paper/sepia/night) independent of app chrome, clickable Library rows +
  state-based view switch (no router dep). Out: reading-position/resume (unit 06), highlights (unit 10) —
  opens at page 1. UI unit → frontend-design + impeccable before review.
  **STATUS: BUILT (Sonnet, TDD: 44 web tests — 7 page-visibility pure helpers, 7 reader-page behaviour,
  1 app-navigation, +29 pre-existing) → impeccable polish (a11y: page-indicator live region now announces
  ONLY in paged mode — scroll mode updates currentPage every tick so a persistent live region spammed SRs;
  + hairline `border-line` on page cards so sheets read as discrete paper on all 3 reader themes) →
  fresh-context review (Opus) = **APPROVE-WITH-NITS**, NO blockers. Applied both SHOULD-FIX: App.tsx title
  lookup moved from a useState-initializer side-effect → a proper `useEffect([store, docId])` w/ cancel
  guard; paged-mode keydown effect given an explicit dep array (`[currentPage,numPages,onPageChange]`) +
  inlined nav, killing per-render listener churn. Gates: typecheck 9 ✓ · test 44 web ✓ · lint 6 ✓.
  packages/ byte-identical to main (no pdf.js leak into core/store; text-layer shape NOT promoted — that's
  05b). Dep added: pdfjs-dist@6.0.227 (ESM; worker via `?url` Vite import; no allowBuilds entry needed).
  Files: src/reader/{pdf,use-pdf-document,page-visibility}.ts + {pdf-page,reader-page}.tsx + 3 test files;
  store/web-store.ts (+`getPdfBytes`→blobs.get, ONLY store change); App.tsx (+openDocId state-nav);
  document-row.tsx/library-page.tsx (rows clickable +onOpen). **Reviewer NITs deferred:** (1) exported+tested
  `mostVisiblePage` is unused — ScrollReader uses an inline IntersectionObserver topmost-visible heuristic;
  wire it or drop the dead export in a later polish (browser-verify indicator tracking). (2) dpr/scale calc
  duplicated in pdf-page. **Follow-up (own micro-unit, packages/tokens — don't widen 05a):** page-card
  `border-line`/paged-button `bg-line` use the APP-chrome `line` token (not redefined under
  `[data-reader-theme]`), so page edges/hover follow app chrome, not the reader theme. Add reader-scoped
  `reader-line`/`reader-muted` tokens. (reader-bg/reader-text themselves track the reader theme correctly.)
  **POST-VERIFY FIX (browser bug found by user): the pdf.js text layer rendered as OPAQUE, unscaled,
  misaligned black text stamped over each page.** Root cause: pdf.js v6 `TextLayer.render()` only sets
  per-glyph vars (`--font-height`/`--scale-x`/`--rotate`) and sizes glyphs as
  `calc(var(--total-scale-factor) * --font-height)` — the CALLER must (a) apply the `.textLayer` CSS
  (transparent color + absolute positioning) and (b) set `--total-scale-factor` on the container. We did
  neither. Fix (commit 81137e5): styles.css gained the structural `.textLayer` rules from pdfjs-dist v6
  (unlayered so they beat Tailwind utilities; native `::selection` kept so selection stays visible);
  pdf-page.tsx sets `--total-scale-factor` to the CSS render scale + uses `className="textLayer"`, dropping
  the hand-rolled inline positioning. Gates green; user BROWSER-VERIFIED (canvas-only, text selects + tracks
  glyphs). **Carry-forward: any pdf.js text layer needs BOTH the `.textLayer` CSS and `--total-scale-factor`
  set by the caller — `TextLayer.render()` alone is not enough.**
  **Unit 05a (#42) MERGED** — PR #43 merged to main (merge commit 26dd9b0), branch deleted, BROWSER-VERIFIED
  by user (render/scroll, paged toggle, text selection, paper/sepia/night, scanned PDF no-text-layer + no
  error all ✓).
- **Unit 05b SPECCED (2026-06-09) — mobile PDF reader (#44, umbrella #5), route standard.** Spec:
  specs/05b-mobile-pdf-reader.md. **ENGINE PIVOT (user-confirmed this session): pdf.js in a
  `react-native-webview`, NOT react-native-pdf.** Rationale: ONE engine for render+text = exact 05a parity
  (unit-10 highlight anchors fall out free) + stays in Expo Go (webview is bundled there; react-native-pdf is
  a native module → would have forced a custom dev client / EAS build). **Supersedes the architecture.md
  `react-native-pdf` pin** — update that row + mark the mobile-text-extraction Open Question resolved IN THE
  05b PR. **05 SPLIT FURTHER (user): 05b = render + reader UI only; 05c = structured text-geometry extraction
  across the RN↔WebView bridge + promote the shared text-layer shape to packages/core (the unit-10 parity
  piece).** 05b scope (apps/mobile only): tappable DocumentRow → expo-router `/reader/[id]` → ReaderScreen
  (native uniwind toolbar: back/title/`page X of N`/mode/theme) hosting a WebView pdf.js reader (static
  `assets/reader/` HTML, base64 bytes over postMessage, scroll default + paged toggle, reader theme
  paper/sepia/night INSIDE the WebView — uniwind has no reader-theme axis, so native chrome stays app-themed).
  Only store change: additive `getPdfBytes` on native-store (mirror 05a web-store). New deps: react-native-webview
  (`expo install`, Expo-Go-bundled) + pdfjs-dist@6.0.227 (pin = web). Reader is real UI → no throwaway dev
  harness; device-verify = open a PDF in Expo Go. Tests: native seams only (getPdfBytes + any pure helper) —
  WebView/render is device-bound. Build-validate from official docs (not memory): the expo-asset/WebView
  asset-loading mechanism, pdf.js worker in a WebView, base64 bridge size.
  **STATUS: MERGED → done. BUILT (Sonnet executor, cut off by a session limit → orchestrator finished the gates)
  → fresh-context review (Opus) = CHANGES-REQUESTED → fixed → re-review = B1/S1 RESOLVED → DEVICE-VERIFIED (user,
  Expo Go, after the device-only fixes below) → committed/PR/merged. Gates: typecheck 9 ✓ · test 44 web +
  34 mobile ✓ · lint 6 ✓ · `expo export -p android` → Exported: dist ✓.**
  - **3 DEVICE-ONLY BUGS (none catchable by any local gate — WebView runtime only; found via the user's Expo Go
    pass + the in-WebView error→RN instrumentation we added):**
    1. **ES modules + blob workers do NOT run from an opaque origin.** `WebView source={{ html }}` loads the doc
       with an `about:blank`/opaque origin; pdf.js v6 is ESM-only, so the `<script type=module>` (which posts
       `ready`) was SILENTLY skipped → infinite spinner, no error. **Fix: give the doc a real origin —
       `source={{ html, baseUrl: 'https://ember.reader/' }}`.** This also unblocks the blob-URL worker.
       **Carry-forward: any react-native-webview hosting ESM/module scripts or blob workers MUST set a real
       `baseUrl`; `source={{html}}` alone gives an opaque origin that silently skips modules.**
    2. **Redeclaration crash.** `const { GlobalWorkerOptions, getDocument, TextLayer } = pdfjsLib` collided with
       pdf.mjs's own top-level exported bindings of those names in the SAME inline-module scope → "Identifier
       GlobalWorkerOptions has already been declared". **Fix: reference `pdfjsLib.<name>` directly; never
       destructure pdf.mjs's exported names into local consts in the inlined module.**
    3. **Silent hangs are undebuggable on device** → added an instrumentation layer (kept): a classic pre-module
       `<script>` defines `postToRN` + global `error`/`unhandledrejection` handlers; the reader posts `stage`
       messages (webview-booted→decoding→getDocument); RN has a 25s hang watchdog + shows the real failure reason
       in the error notice. THIS is what surfaced bugs 1 & 2. **Carry-forward: instrument WebView readers to
       report errors/stages back to RN — local gates can't see WebView-runtime failures.**
    - Also hardened the worker (real module `Worker` via `workerPort`, fallback to `workerSrc`). Reminder: the
      `bundle-pdfjs.mjs` comment + any code INSIDE the HTML template literal must avoid backticks/`${` (they
      close the template) — bit us twice this session.
  - **ASSET MECHANISM CHOSEN: inline pdf.js as a string, NOT expo-asset URIs.** `scripts/bundle-pdfjs.mjs`
    (run by `predev` + `typecheck`) reads `node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/{pdf,pdf.worker}.mjs` and writes them as
    string consts into `src/reader/pdf-js-content.ts` (GITIGNORED, regenerated). `build-reader-html.ts` embeds
    pdf.mjs as an inline `<script type=module>` + the worker as a Blob URL (`GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc`),
    served via `WebView source={{ html }}`. No file:// URI resolution, no Metro asset config, fully offline.
    Trade-off: ~3MB inlined → 11MB android bundle (acceptable; file-stream optimization deferred to 05c/perf).
  - **BLOCKER found+fixed in review (B1 — would've shipped a permanent spinner): RN→WebView `postMessage` is
    NOT queued; the in-page `message` listener only attaches AFTER the 3MB pdf.js module evaluates, so the
    initial `load` raced and was dropped → no `ready` → stuck loading. Fix: a `bootReady` handshake — the page
    posts `bootReady` once its listener is attached; RN gates all load/mode/theme posts on it and flushes on
    receipt.** Carry-forward: ANY RN↔WebView bridge that posts INTO a WebView needs a readiness handshake — the
    native postMessage has no queue. (S1: removed dead `onWebViewRef`/no-deps effect. NIT: in-HTML `setMode`
    now stores the requested mode even pre-load so `loadPdf`→`applyMode` can open directly in paged later.)
  - **Tooling fixes this unit:** eslint config — widened the mobile React-version pin glob to `mjs,cjs` so the
    new Node build script skips the ESLint-10 react-version-detection crash; `.gitignore` += `src/reader/pdf-js-content.ts`.
    **CI note (follow-up): `expo export` does NOT run `predev`, so any CI export step must run `bundle-pdfjs`
    (or `typecheck`) first or a fresh clone exports against the missing generated file.**
  - **NIT (deferred, WebView-local — fine per spec's invariant-#6 exception): sepia/night page-border hexes
    (#D4C5A6 / #2A2420) in build-reader-html are invented (not in tokens/ui-context); paper border = the `line`
    token. Could document in ui-context.md later.**
- **Unit 05c SCORED COMPLEX → split by boundary (2026-06-10).** Build-plan 05c (structured text-geometry
  extraction across the RN↔WebView bridge + promote the shared text-layer shape to packages/core, the
  unit-10 parity piece) crosses 3 boundaries (core shape + web extract + mobile WebView→RN bridge) AND the
  shape was undesigned → COMPLEX. Split like 03a/b/c & 05a/b: **05c-1** core shape + pure normalizer (#46,
  this — SPECCED) → **05c-2** web extraction + golden parity test (apps/web) → **05c-3** mobile
  WebView-extract + RN bridge, device-bound (apps/mobile; the literal highlight-anchor parity payoff for #10).
  **Design RESOLVED (user, 2026-06-10):** (1) per-item granularity — one entry per pdf.js TextContent item
  carrying `str` + bbox + reading-order `index` (unit 10 resolves `(page,startChar,endChar)`→rects from these);
  (2) coordinates normalized 0..1 of the page, top-left origin, y-down → web & mobile feeding the same pdf.js
  output through the SAME core function produce identical geometry **by construction** (the parity property),
  consistent with the reading-position relative-offset model. 05c-1 route = **standard** (single boundary
  packages/core, no new dep, pure TS — no pdf.js/DOM import; input is a minimal `RawTextItem` projection,
  mirroring the Hasher/SqliteDriver port pattern). Spec: specs/05c-core-text-geometry.md. Files: new
  `packages/core/src/text-geometry.ts` (+ barrel line) + `src/tests/text-geometry.test.ts` (fixture-based,
  no pdf.js). **05c-1 BUILT (2026-06-10) — PR #47 open, Closes #46.** TDD executor (Sonnet) → fresh-context
  Opus review = APPROVE (nits only, none blocking). `normalizePageText()` + the promoted shape shipped;
  15 fixture tests incl. the scale-independence parity property; typecheck/test(45)/lint all green; core
  purity held (zero imports). **05c-1 MERGED (2026-06-10) — PR #47 squash-merged, #46 closed, branch deleted, main synced.**
  - **05c-2 SPECCED (2026-06-10) — Issue #48, Closes #48, branch feat/48-web-text-geometry, spec specs/05c-web-text-geometry.md.**
    Route **standard** (single boundary apps/web; pdfjs-dist already a web dep — no new dep; ambiguity resolved with user).
    apps/web produces the core geometry shape from real pdf.js + a **golden parity fixture captured from real pdf.js (Node
    legacy build)** — committed `test-fixtures/{sample.pdf,raw-textcontent.json,expected-geometry.json}` become the contract
    05c-3 (mobile) diffs byte-for-byte. New `page-geometry.ts` adapter (filters TextMarkedContent, type-only pdf.js import →
    `normalizePageText`); `pdf-page.tsx` fires optional `onTextGeometry?(geometry)` from the live render path (no consumer
    yet — unit 10's seam); `capture-geometry.mjs` one-time generator mirroring mobile `bundle-pdfjs.mjs`. **Design RESOLVED
    (user, 2026-06-10):** (1) golden source = real-pdf.js Node capture (not hand-authored — faithful for the byte-diff
    contract); (2) wire via optional callback now (not deferred). Tautology guard: golden snapshot = regression lock;
    independent hand-computed spot-checks (top→small y, bottom→large y) validate the golden itself.
  - **05c-2 MERGED (2026-06-10) — PR #49 squash-merged, #48 closed, branch deleted, main synced.** Built by Sonnet TDD
    executor → fresh-context Opus high-effort code-review = **APPROVE, no correctness bugs**. Verify all green: typecheck 9 ✓ ·
    test 55/12 files ✓ · lint 6 ✓; `node apps/web/scripts/capture-geometry.mjs` extracts 2 items + writes both goldens. Files:
    `apps/web/src/reader/page-geometry.ts` (+test), `pdf-page.tsx` (onTextGeometry seam), `scripts/capture-geometry.mjs`,
    `test-fixtures/{sample.pdf,raw-textcontent.json,expected-geometry.json}`, `src/tests/pdf-page-geometry.test.tsx`.
    Implementation note: type-only pdf.js import uses deep path `pdfjs-dist/types/src/display/api` (top-level doesn't re-export
    `TextContent`/`TextItem`). 3 advisory review findings (non-blocking): (1) `onTextGeometry` in render-effect deps — unit-10
    consumer must pass a stable callback identity or the canvas+TextLayer re-renders; (2) `capture-geometry.mjs` inlines the
    core normalizer (Node can't resolve workspace `.ts` exports) — drift caught at test time; (3) spot-checks hardcode font
    metrics (intentional, keeps them independent of the golden).
  - **05c-3 SPECCED (2026-06-10) — Issue #50, Closes #50, branch feat/50-mobile-text-geometry, spec specs/05c-mobile-text-geometry.md.**
    Route **standard** (single boundary apps/mobile; no new dep — pdfjs-dist/react-native-webview from 05b + @ember/core already
    deps; not a UI unit). Final 05c slice: the mobile WebView extracts per-item text geometry and RN reproduces the committed web
    golden BYTE-FOR-BYTE through the SAME @ember/core normalizer = the unit-10 highlight-anchor parity payoff.
    **Design RESOLVED (parity by construction):** (1) WebView PROJECTS (posts raw {pageNumber,viewport(scale-1),items} — the SAME
    shape 05c-2's raw-textcontent.json captured), RN NORMALIZES via real @ember/core normalizePageText → headlessly testable + same
    function as web; (2) bridge message shape == web golden shape by design, so the parity test feeds the COMMITTED
    apps/web/test-fixtures/raw-textcontent.json → asserts expected-geometry.json (single source of truth, no copy, no device);
    (3) surface via optional onTextGeometry on ReaderWebView (no consumer — unit-10 seam; ReaderScreen untouched), fired per page
    from the existing getTextContent() path. Device-bound: extraction runs in the WebView → throwaway app/dev/ screen loads the
    committed sample.pdf, extracts on-device, diffs expected-geometry.json → PASS, then DELETED in this PR (03c/04c convention).
    **05c-3 MERGED (2026-06-10) — PR #51 squash-merged to main, #50 closed, branch deleted, main synced (CI verify ✓ 59s).
    Completes the 05c chain (05c-1 core shape → 05c-2 web golden → 05c-3 mobile parity).** TDD executor (Sonnet) →
    fresh-context Opus review = **APPROVE-WITH-NITS**,
    NO blockers (confirmed parity test genuine/not self-fulfilling, adapter pure, scale-1 viewport, core/store/web/ReaderScreen
    byte-untouched; re-ran all gates). Permanent surface: `src/reader/page-geometry.ts` (`geometryFromBridge` — drops
    TextMarkedContent, projects, calls core `normalizePageText`; the byte-for-byte golden parity test reads apps/web's committed
    `raw-textcontent.json`→`expected-geometry.json`), `build-reader-html.ts` (posts `{type:'geometry',pageNumber,viewport(scale-1),
    items}` per page from the existing getTextContent path), `reader-webview.tsx` (geometry msg → optional `onTextGeometry`).

    - **3 device-only harness bugs found+fixed during the user's pass (harness-only — permanent surface untouched; carry-forwards):**
      1. **`readAsStringAsync` from the NEW `expo-file-system` API throws (deprecated).** Use `expo-file-system/legacy` (the 04c rule);
         to read a BUNDLED asset, legacy `downloadAsync(resolveAssetSource(uri), dest)` → `readAsStringAsync(dest,{encoding:'base64'})`
         → `base64ToBytes` (Metro asset URI is http:// in dev, so stage to scoped cache first).
      2. **The WebView reader renders LAZILY via IntersectionObserver in scroll mode** — a hidden/1px WebView never renders page 1,
         so the geometry post (inside `renderPage`) never fires. A headless geometry harness must size the WebView visibly AND use
         **paged mode** (renders page 1 immediately on load, not gated on intersection).
      3. **The dev index needs a reachable link** — `app/index.tsx` (home) had no `/dev` link after 03c/04c harnesses were deleted;
         a `__DEV__` link from home is required to reach `app/dev/`.
    - Throwaway dev harness (`app/dev/` + the home `__DEV__` link + the copied `assets/sample-golden.pdf`) DELETED post-PASS in the
      same PR (03c/04c convention); only the permanent surface remains. One review nit left as-is (matches web's adapter): the
      `transform` type guard checks presence not `Array.isArray` — theoretical only (real pdf.js always sends a length-6 array).
- **Unit 04c (#40) build context (historical — already MERGED, see above):**
  Spec: specs/04c-mobile-import-library-list.md, route **standard**. Binds 04a ports to native: `BlobStore`→
  expo-file-system, `Hasher`→expo-crypto, `Repository`→existing SqliteRepository/expoSqliteDriver (03c),
  + kv-store-persisted HLC clock; bespoke uniwind Library screen (expo-document-picker PDF import, dedupe,
  recently-added-first, theme control). New deps: expo-file-system/expo-crypto/expo-document-picker (via
  `expo install`) + `sonner-native@0.26.1` (toast feedback) which pulls `react-native-svg` (peer); +allowBuilds
  for any with a build script. Independent of 04d (shadcn is web-only). Throwaway device-verify screen per
  ai-workflow-rules. Decisions (this session): document-picker (no drag-drop on mobile); new expo-file-system
  OO API; clock persists via expo-sqlite/kv-store (settled); Library replaces the home-screen placeholder;
  **sonner-native toasts (not an inline banner)** themed from useTheme — mirrors 04d's web Sonner retrofit.
  native-clock/format-bytes mirror web's (dedup hoist deferred — don't widen web).
  **STATUS: BUILT (Sonnet, TDD: mobile 20 tests) → impeccable polish (token-resolved spinner tint killed

  card/empty-state copy + em-dash; pressed CTA state) → fresh-context review (Opus) = APPROVE-WITH-NITS.
  Fixes applied: mixed-batch toast now tallies added vs deduped (was last-file-only); corrected the dev
  harness SHA-256("abc") vector (was wrong → device check would've always failed); tightened the dedupe
  test to assert `repo.unacked()` length directly (invariant #2). Gates: typecheck 9 ✓ · test 25 mobile ✓ ·

  (+react-native-svg/sonner-native in allowBuilds).
- **3 device-only bugs surfaced during the user's device pass — none catchable by typecheck/test/bundle;
  CARRY-FORWARD for future mobile units:**
  1. **expo-sqlite/kv-store via `require` needs the default instance.** `getItemSync`/`setItemSync` are
     methods on the *default export* (`export default AsyncStorage`; alias `Storage`), NOT top-level named
     exports — so `require('expo-sqlite/kv-store').getItemSync` is undefined. Reach `.default`/`.Storage`
     (native-clock.ts). (Static `import Storage from '…'` like the theme provider also works.)
  2. **uniwind `className` is a no-op on third-party components** (e.g. `SafeAreaView` from
     react-native-safe-area-context) — it only styles RN core / `withUniwind`-wrapped comps (02d rule).
     Put `bg-surface`/padding on a core `View`; use SafeAreaView only for insets via `style`.
  3. **Reading a document-picker pick on Android/Expo Go:** new `File.bytes()` rejects SAF `content://`
     ("Missing READ permission"); `copyToCacheDirectory:true` lands in `cache/DocumentPicker/` which is
     outside Expo Go's readable scope ("isn't readable"). Working pattern (pick-pdf.ts): pick with
     `copyToCacheDirectory:false` → legacy `copyAsync` (ContentResolver) into scoped `cacheDirectory` →
     `readAsStringAsync` base64 → decode via the pure unit-tested `base64.ts`. Works in Expo Go + standalone.
  **Process carry-forward (user): pick mobile/Expo APIs from the OFFICIAL docs, not type stubs/memory —
  runtime constraints (SAF scoping, Expo Go sandbox) don't show in any local gate. See memory.**
- Backlog lives in GitHub Issues (repo pena56/ember); Unit NN ⇄ Issue #NN ⇄ feat/NN-… ⇄
  specs/NN-….md ⇄ PR "Closes #NN".

## Durable decisions (project-wide)
- **KV persistence via `expo-sqlite/kv-store`, NOT AsyncStorage** (2026-06-08): expo-sqlite is the
  chosen local store (architecture.md); its kv-store is an AsyncStorage-compatible, SQLite-backed
  API — one fewer dependency.

## Completed
- (scaffolding) Context files generated from grill-me planning + look/feel session.
- Stack chosen and versions pinned (architecture.md, verified 2026-06-08).
- Build plan drafted (specs/00-build-plan.md, units 01–17).
- **Unit 01 done** (2026-06-08): pnpm + Turborepo monorepo scaffold on branch
  `feat/01-monorepo-tooling-scaffold`. Spec: specs/01-monorepo-tooling-scaffold.md.
  Built (Sonnet) → fresh-context review (Opus) found 2 blockers + 2 should-fixes → fixed → re-verified.
  All verify commands green AND now cover convex:
  `pnpm -w typecheck` ✓ (8 tasks, incl. @ember/convex) · `pnpm -w test` ✓ · `pnpm -w lint` ✓ (6 tasks, incl. @ember/convex).
  ESLint flat config enforces kebab-case filenames, PascalCase no-I-prefix types, import-x/order;
  apps/mobile extends eslint-config-expo, convex/ uses @convex-dev/eslint-plugin (both wired into Turbo).
  Decision recorded in architecture.md: eslint-plugin-import → eslint-plugin-import-x@4.16.2 (v2 incompatible with ESLint 10).
  Convex hand-scaffolded as workspace member @ember/convex (schema.ts empty defineSchema, package.json, convex.json,
  tsconfig.json); user must run `npx convex dev` once to provision deployment and generate `convex/_generated`.

## Next Up
- **Unit 02d — Mobile theming** (`apps/mobile`): uniwind + Metro (`withUniwindConfig`,
  `cssEntryFile: src/global.css` importing `tailwindcss` + `uniwind` + `@ember/tokens/theme.uniwind.css`),
  theme provider using `Uniwind.setTheme`/`useUniwind` (system/light/dark) persisted via
  AsyncStorage, fonts via `@expo-google-fonts/fraunces`+`inter`, themed chrome. Depends on 02c (#22).
  Open new issue when specced. Reader-theme switching on mobile deferred to reader unit 05.
- Manual follow-up: run `npx convex dev` from repo root to provision the Convex dev
  deployment and generate `convex/_generated`.

## uniwind research (2026-06-08, for 02c/02d — verified from docs.uniwind.dev)
- metro: `withUniwindConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), { cssEntryFile, extraThemes, dtsFile })`.
  No babel preset. Restart with `expo start --clear`.
- global.css: `@import 'tailwindcss'; @import 'uniwind';` then theme fragment.
- Theming: token names in `@theme` (utility generation) + per-theme values in
  `@layer theme { :root { @variant light {} @variant dark {} } }`. Built-in themes light/dark/system.
- Runtime: `Uniwind.setTheme('light'|'dark'|'system')`, `Uniwind.currentTheme`,
  `useUniwind() → { theme, hasAdaptiveThemes }`. `dark:` variant for classes.
- className works on RN core components (View/Text); wrap 3rd-party with `withUniwind(Comp)`.

## Unit 02 build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done: `@ember/tokens` emits Amber Ember tokens twice — typed TS (`src/index.ts`) + Tailwind v4
  `@theme` fragment (`src/theme.css`, exported as `@ember/tokens/theme.css`). Parity test guards
  TS↔CSS drift across BOTH app themes + reader themes. No new deps. All verify green.
- Built (Sonnet, TDD) → fresh-context review (Opus) = APPROVE-WITH-NITS; applied both SHOULD-FIX
  inline: reader colors moved into `@theme` (so `bg-reader-bg`/`text-reader-text` utilities
  generate; selector blocks override sepia/night), parity test extended to warm-dark + reader.
- Carry-forward for 02b/02c: `theme.css` is a fragment with NO `@import "tailwindcss"` — clients
  MUST import it after their own Tailwind entry. Reader colors default to paper in `@theme`.

## Unit 02b build notes (2026-06-08)
- Done (apps/web): `@tailwindcss/vite` + `@import "tailwindcss"` then `@ember/tokens/theme.css`;
  ThemeProvider (`system`/light/dark, default system, persisted, FOUC inline script in index.html
  matching the provider's resolution rule); self-hosted Fraunces+Inter via @fontsource; minimal
  themed shell + segmented theme control; jsdom + RTL tests (10).
- Built (Sonnet, TDD) → impeccable polish (fixed broken `rounded-radius-md`→`rounded-md`, added
  focus-visible rings, redesigned active state token-purely) → fresh-context review (Opus) =
  CHANGES-REQUESTED → fixed: **BLOCKER** font family mismatch (`@fontsource-variable/fraunces`
  registers `'Fraunces Variable'` ≠ token `'Fraunces'` → swapped to non-variable
  `@fontsource/fraunces@5.2.9`); wordmark `text-accent`→`text-text` (warm-light accent-on-surface
  was 2.95:1, below AA large-text). All verify green + web build OK.
- **Token follow-up (defer to tokens pkg / before 02c):** to use the *variable* Fraunces (optical
  sizing, the documented design intent), widen `--font-serif` to `'Fraunces Variable', 'Fraunces',
  serif` in theme.css so both the variable and static packages resolve. Out of 02b's boundary.

## Open Questions (resolve before/at the relevant unit)
- ~~**Mobile text-layer extraction** (unit 05)~~ **RESOLVED 2026-06-09 (user) + confirmed 05b build:**
  Engine is **pdf.js inside a react-native-webview** (render AND text layer, same pdfjs-dist@6.0.227 as web).
  One engine → exact 05a parity; selectable text layer ships in 05b; geometry extraction to RN core is 05c.
  architecture.md updated: mobile PDF row changed from react-native-pdf to pdfjs-dist-in-WebView.
- **Convex auth provider** (unit 11): which sign-in method(s) — email link, OAuth (Google/Apple)?
- **Quota numbers** (unit 13): confirm defaults (e.g. 2GB/user, 100MB/file) and monetization path.
- **Web reader leaf decisions**: font/scroll polish — safe to decide during build.

## Resolved decisions (2026-06-08, grill-me — promoted to ui-context.md / architecture.md)
- **Components:** bespoke token-driven per client; styling via Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`
  web) + uniwind (mobile). Tokens authored once as Tailwind v4 `@theme`.
- **Fonts:** Fraunces (serif/headings/streak numbers) + Inter (sans/body/UI).
- **Palette "Amber Ember":** accent `#E0701B`; warm-light surface `#FAF4EA`/text `#2A2422`;
  warm-dark surface `#1C1815`/text `#F2E9DB`; reader paper/sepia/night defined in ui-context.md.
- **Deploy:** trunk-based, tag-gated prod. Web→Cloudflare Pages, Convex→staging+tag-prod,
  Mobile→EAS Update OTA (native build/submit deferred). Secrets per architecture.md Deployment.

## Architecture Decisions (durable — promoted to architecture.md invariants)
- On-device store is source of truth; Convex is sync server, never on read path.
- HLC for ordering; SHA-256 for document identity; sessions are an immutable derived-from log.
- Conflict rules: furthest-page (overridable), union annotations/tags, additive sessions.
- Anonymous-local → account claim processed as a merge event.
- Hybrid notifications de-duplicated via primary-device election + delivery ledger.
- Shared `packages/core` (pure TS) + `Repository` store abstraction (SQLite/Dexie).
- Lint/format: official configs (typescript-eslint base + eslint-config-expo for mobile +
  react-hooks/jsx-a11y for web), Prettier. Conventions: kebab-case files & dirs, PascalCase
  types (no `I`-prefix), grouped/ordered imports via `@ember/*` aliases — all enforced in the
  flat config wired in unit 01 (see code-standards.md + architecture.md Tooling).

## Session Notes
- Project root: `C:\Users\MOSES\Documents\personal\ember`.
- Design fully specified across architecture.md / ui-context.md; resume by picking the next
  build-plan unit and running `spec-unit`.
